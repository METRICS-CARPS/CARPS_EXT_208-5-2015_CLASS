For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section pertaining to "Prediction of outcomes in actual elections in Korea and the United States".

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Prediction of outcomes in actual elections in Korea and the United States. Next, we investigated whether perceived competence, for which there was consensus within and between cultures, could predict election results in the United States and Korea. The percentage of successfully elected candidates rated as more competent was calculated separately for each participant for each election location. These scores were submitted to a 2 (participant’s culture: Koreans vs. Americans) × 2 (election location: Korea vs. United States) mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with election location as a within-subjects factor. There was a strong main effect of election location such that perceived competence was a better predictor of the outcome of American elections than of Korean elections, F(1, 129) = 115.98, p < .001, ηp2 = .47. Note that the significance of this election-location effect was driven by actual voters in real elections, not by participants in the present research. More specifically, this finding suggests that American voters in real elections voted for the competent-looking candidates, whereas this tendency was significantly weaker among Korean voters in real elections. The strength of this effect is illustrated by the means (Korean elections: 51.38%; American elections: 61.13%) and confidence intervals associated with the effect, difference = 9.75 percentage points, 95% CI = [7.94, 11.57]. There was no effect of participants’ culture, F < 1. There was, however, a Participant’s Culture × Election Location interaction, F(1, 129) = 6.17, p = .014, ηp2 = .05. Although the interaction was statistically significant, the 95% CIs did not clearly separate the interaction means. We discuss this interaction in the next section.

> Korean participants. Next, we examined the consistency of the main effect within each culture. First, among Koreans, candidates who were perceived as more competent won in 61.92% of American elections but in only 49.98% of Korean elections, t(66) = 9.08, p < .001 (Fig. 1). The effect size for the difference (11.94 percentage points) was large, d = 1.11, and even the lower limit of the 95% CI was larger than zero, 95% CI = [9.32, 14.57]. Moreover, Koreans’ competence judgments predicted the U.S. election results at a level better than chance (i.e., 50%), difference = 11.92 percentage points, d = 2.73, 95% CI = [9.77, 14.07]. However, Koreans’ competence judgments predicted Korean election results at chance levels, difference = −0.02 percentage points, 95% CI = [−2.05, 2.01]. We also note that the difference from chance for Koreans predicting American election results was significant, t(66) = 11.08, p < .00. This was not the case for Koreans predicting Korean election results, t(66) = 0.02, n.s. American participants. Conceptually, the same pattern was observed for Americans (Fig. 1). For Americans, more winning candidates were perceived as more competent than their competitors in American elections (60.31%) than in Korean elections (52.85%). Again, the effect size for the difference (7.46 percentage points) was large, d = 0.70, and the lower limit of the 95% CI was above zero,95% CI = [5.01, 9.92]. The difference was statistically significant, t(63) = 6.09, p < .001. In addition, Americans’ competence judgments predicted American election results at a level better than chance, difference = 10.31 percentage points, t(63) = 11.53, 95% CI = [8.52, 12.10], p < .001, d = 2.90. However, for Korean elections, the difference from chance was relatively small (2.85 percentage points), and the lower limit of the 95% CI was close to zero, 95% CI = [0.49, 5.21], although the difference was significant, t(63) = 2.41, p = .019, d = 0.61.
